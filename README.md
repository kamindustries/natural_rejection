# Natural Rejection
This is a visualization primarily of extinct species from the Tree of Life Web Project. Data is not included in this repository. To run the visualization, a file called "tree_of_life_complete.xml" needs to be in the data/ directory. Information about the database and how to access it can be found here:

http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/downloadtree.html 

Alternatively, changing the value of FULL_TREE in natural_rejection.pde will use harpalinae.xml which contains about 1,300 nodes and was used for testing.

Images of the project can be seen here:
